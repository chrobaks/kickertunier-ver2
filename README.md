This is a developByLearning-project with first steps in angular. The application shows
a kickertunier-ui where you can add/delete user, teams and games and set a active game with
two teams and some click-events.

There is a simple REST api with php and mysql. Used it by rename restconfig.php.dim into restconfig.php,
the Mysql-Dump is inside the rest-directory. Set the Dump to your Database and open restconfig.php to
set your own DB-Configparams.
